## Fileserver  
### This is an android application that embeds a custom minimal file server. It can serves files over http through the browser. See the screenshot folder for an example  

### Use Case   
Say you are on a VPN or peer network such as WLAN. you can use this app to serve files to other connected devices.   
It has no UI. just launch the app and head to your browser on port 6646 i.e localhost:6646. you can share your IP address with users on the same network so they could acess your files.
